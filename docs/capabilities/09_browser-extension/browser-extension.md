## Browser Extension

*Note that this [**Glue42 Core+**](https://glue42.com/core-plus/) feature is still under development. For more information, [contact us](https://glue42.com/contacts/) at `info@glue42.com`.*

The Browser Extension is an installable extension that provides an out-of-the-box setup for the [**Glue42 Core+**](https://glue42.com/core-plus/) environment, replacing the need for a [Main app](../../developers/core-concepts/web-platform/overview/index.html) in your project. The extension provides the connection between the [Web Client](../../developers/core-concepts/web-client/overview/index.html) apps, supports connecting to app and Layout stores, can inject the [Glue42 Web](../../reference/core/latest/glue42%20web/index.html) library and an [FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org/) implementation for your apps to use, has a fully configured [Workspaces App](../windows/workspaces/workspaces-app/index.html) and a [Notifications](../notifications/setup/index.html) library. It also contains the Glue42 Interop Viewer and Context Viewer developer tools and an optional widget that can be used in [Web Client](../../developers/core-concepts/web-client/overview/index.html) apps to show the Glue42 connection status and a Channel Selector.

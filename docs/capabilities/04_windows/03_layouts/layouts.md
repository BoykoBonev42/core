End-users in large enterprises often have multi-monitor setups on which they arrange the necessary apps in the most convenient way for executing daily tasks. The [**Glue42 Core+**](https://glue42.com/core-plus/) Layouts feature allows them to save and later restore the exact arrangement and context of their apps. Users can save multiple apps and [Workspaces](../workspaces/overview/index.html) in different Layouts, each corresponding to a specific task or workflow. Restoring the saved Layout happens with a single click and saves time and effort for finding, launching and arranging the desired apps.

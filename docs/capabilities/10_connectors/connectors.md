It is common for large enterprises to depend heavily on established third-party apps like Excel, Salesforce or Bloomberg. Integration with these apps is critical, but often complicated. The [**Glue42 Core+**](https://glue42.com/core-plus/) Connectors enable your web apps to integrate easily with Bloomberg, Fidessa, Salesforce, Excel, Outlook and more, saving your organization considerable development effort and resources.

# Glue42 Intents Resolver

The **Glue42 Intents Resolver** library offers a way to create custom Intents Resolver. This application is used to provide the user with a list of all available applications and running instances which can handle a raised intent.<br>
**Intents Resolver** is enabled by default. You can use our template [**Glue42 Intents Resolver UI**](https://github.com/Glue42/core/tree/master/templates/intents-resolver) application. Copy the project, build it and serve it. Then, reference its application definition in your **Glue42 Web Platform** configuration. Now each application whish raises an intent will use **Intents Resolver**.
